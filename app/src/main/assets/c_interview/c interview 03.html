The idea is that if the code is in fact correct, you simply remove the comment symbols and continue on. It also saves you time and effort on having to retype the codes if you have deleted it in the first place.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; -aw-import:ignore">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
