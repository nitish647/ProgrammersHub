Swift makes us develop software that is incredibly fast, robust and secure.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">This language is the most useful programming language that is used to develop an application for macOS and iOS(iPad and iPhone).</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">There are some important advantages offered by developing apps for macOS and iOS using swift.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Open-source language: The Swift programming language has been created as an open-source and is being open to everyone, this makes it simple for the program to upgrade all the source codes, email lists and bug tracker at regular intervals.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Easy to learn and maintain: Swift programing language is more simple and accurate when compared to C/C++. Apple evolved its programing language to be easy to use and syntaxes are taken from programming languages such as C#, Python, and Ruby. These simple syntax of this programing language make it more meaningful. In swift, all the content of the implementation (.m) and header (.h) files are combined in a single file that is (.swift).</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Supported by multiple devices: Swift programming language is not just limited to support Apple devices, it will also support multiple devices of the technology world like Linux and Windows devices.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Supports dynamic libraries: Dynamic libraries are the executable chunks of the code that can be connected to an app. This feature allows the latest swift programing language. In swift, dynamic libraries are directly uploaded to the memory, thereby resulting in deduction down on the initial size of the app and finally increases app performance.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Optional types: An optional in swift is a type that can be held either as a value or not. To declare an optional, we can use a question </span><span style="font-family:Calibri">“</span><span style="font-family:Calibri">?</span><span style="font-family:Calibri">”</span><span style="font-family:Calibri"> mark.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri">Closures: Closures are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in our code.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:Calibri; -aw-import:ignore">&#xa0;</span></p></div></body></html>
