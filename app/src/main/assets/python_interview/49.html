    <em>hallow copy</em>
    is used when a new instance type gets created and it keeps the values that
    are copied in the new instance. Shallow copy is used to copy the reference
    pointers just like it copies the values. These references point to the
    original objects and the changes made in any member of the class will also
    affect the original copy of it. Shallow copy allows faster execution of the
    program and it depends on the size of the data that is used.

    <em>Deep copy</em>
    is used to store the values that are already copied. Deep copy doesn’t copy
    the reference pointers to the objects. It makes the reference to an object
    and the new object that is pointed by some other object gets stored. The
    changes made in the original copy won’t affect any other copy that uses the
    object. Deep copy makes execution of the program slower due to making
    certain copies for each object that is been called.
