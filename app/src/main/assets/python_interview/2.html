        Python is an interpreted language. That means that, unlike languages
        like <em>C</em> and its variants, Python does not need to be compiled
        before it is run. Other interpreted languages include <em>PHP</em> and        <em>Ruby</em>.

        Python is dynamically typed, this means that you don’t need to state
        the types of variables when you declare them or anything like that. You
        can do things like <code>x=111 </code>and then        <code>x="I'm a string"</code> without error

        in that it allows the definition of classes along with composition and
        inheritance. Python does not have access specifiers (like C++’s        <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>).

            functions
        </a>
        are first-class objects. This means that they can be assigned to
        variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions.
        Classes are also first class objects

        Writing Python code is quick but running it is often slower than
        compiled languages. Fortunately，Python allows the inclusion of C based
        extensions so bottlenecks can be optimized away and often are. The

        package is a good example of this, it’s really quite quick because a

        Python finds use in many spheres – web applications, automation,
        scientific modeling, big data applications and many more. It’s also
        often used as “glue” code to get other languages and components to play
        nice.
