    To modify the strings, Python’s “re” module is providing 3 methods. They
    are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        split() – uses a regex pattern to “split” a given string into a list.
    </li>
    <li>
        sub() – finds all substrings where the regex pattern matches and then
        replace them with a different string
    </li>
    <li>
        subn() – it is similar to sub() and also returns the new string along
        with the no. of replacements.
    </li>
</ul>
