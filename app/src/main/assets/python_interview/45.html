        Python’s lists are efficient general-purpose containers. They support
        (fairly) efficient insertion, deletion, appending, and concatenation,
        and Python’s list comprehensions make them easy to construct and
        manipulate.
    </li>
    <li>
        They have certain limitations: they don’t support “vectorized”
        operations like elementwise addition and multiplication, and the fact
        that they can contain objects of differing types mean that Python must
        store type information for every element, and must execute type
        dispatching code when operating on each element.

        is not just more efficient; it is also more convenient. You get a lot
        of vector and matrix operations for free, which sometimes allow one to
        avoid unnecessary work. And they are also efficiently implemented.

        NumPy array is faster and You get a lot built in with NumPy, FFTs,
        convolutions, fast searching, basic statistics, linear algebra,
