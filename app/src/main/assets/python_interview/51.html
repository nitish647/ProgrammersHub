    The compiling and linking allows the new extensions to be compiled properly
    without any error and the linking can be done only when it passes the
    compiled procedure. If the dynamic loading is used then it depends on the
    style that is being provided with the system. The python interpreter can be
    used to provide the dynamic loading of the configuration setup files and
    will rebuild the interpreter.

    The steps that are required in this as:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Create a file with any name and in any language that is supported by
        the compiler of your system. For example file.c or file.cpp
    </li>
    <li>
        Place this file in the Modules/ directory of the distribution which is
        getting used.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add a line in the file Setup.local that is present in the Modules/
        directory.
    </li>
    <li>
        Run the file using spam file.o
    </li>
    <li>
        After a successful run of this rebuild the interpreter by using the
        make command on the top-level directory.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the file is changed then run rebuildMakefile by using the command as
        ‘make Makefile’.
    </li>
</ol>
