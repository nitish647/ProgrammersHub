    For the most part, xrange and range are the exact same in terms of
    functionality. They both provide a way to generate a list of integers for
    you to use, however you please. The only difference is that range returns a
    Python list object and x range returns an xrange object.

<p>
    This means that xrange doesn’t actually generate a static list at run-time
    like range does. It creates the values as you need them with a special
    technique called yielding. This technique is used with a type of object
    known as generators. That means that if you have a really gigantic range
    you’d like to generate a list for, say one billion, xrange is the function
    to use.

    This is especially true if you have a really memory sensitive system such
    as a cell phone that you are working with, as range will use as much memory
    as it can to create your array of integers, which can result in a Memory
    Error and crash your program. It’s a memory hungry beast.
