    Ans: Random module is the standard module that is used to generate a random
    number. The method is defined as:

    The statement random.random() method return the floating point number that
    is in the range of [0, 1). The function generates random float numbers. The
    methods that are used with the random class are the bound methods of the
    hidden instances. The instances of the Random can be done to show the
    multi-threading programs that creates a different instance of individual
    threads. The other random generators that are used in this are:

<ol>
    <li>
        randrange(a, b): it chooses an integer and define the range in-between
        [a, b). It returns the elements by selecting it randomly from the range
        that is specified. It doesnâ€™t build a range object.
    </li>
    <li>
        uniform(a, b): it chooses a floating point number that is defined in
        the range of [a,b).Iyt returns the floating point number
    </li>
    <li>
        normalvariate(mean, sdev): it is used for the normal distribution where
        the mu is a mean and the sdev is a sigma that is used for standard
        deviation.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Random class that is used and instantiated creates an independent
        multiple random number generators.
    </li>
</ol>
