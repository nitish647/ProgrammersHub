<li>
    Memory management in python is managed by        <em>Python private heap space</em>. All Python objects and data
    structures are located in a private heap. The programmer does not have
    access to this private heap. The python interpreter takes care of this
    instead.
</li>
<li>
    The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Pythonâ€™s
    memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the
    programmer to code.
</li>
<li>
    Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the
    unused memory and so that it can be made available to the heap space.
