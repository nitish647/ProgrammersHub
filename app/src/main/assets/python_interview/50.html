        Python has a multi-threading package but if you want to multi-thread to
        speed your code up, then it’s usually not a good idea to use it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Python has a construct called the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The
        GIL makes sure that only one of your ‘threads’ can execute at any one
        time. A thread acquires the GIL, does a little work, then passes the
        GIL onto the next thread.
    </li>
    <li>
        This happens very quickly so to the human eye it may seem like your
        threads are executing in parallel, but they are really just taking
        turns using the same CPU core.
    </li>
    <li>
        All this GIL passing adds overhead to execution. This means that if you
        want to make your code run faster then using the threading package
        often isn’t a good idea.
