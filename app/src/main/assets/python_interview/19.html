    Self is an instance or an object of a class. In Python, this is explicitly
    included as the first parameter. However, this is not the case in Java
    where itâ€™s optional. It helps to differentiate between the methods and
    attributes of a class with local variables.

    The self variable in the init method refers to the newly created object
    while in other methods, it refers to the object whose method was called.
