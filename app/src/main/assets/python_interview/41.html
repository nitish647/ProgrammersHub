    The sequences in Python are indexed and it consists of the positive as well
    as negative numbers. The numbers that are positive uses ‘0’ that is uses as
    first index and ‘1’ as the second index and the process goes on like that.
</p>
<p>
    The index for the negative number starts from ‘-1’ that represents the last
    index in the sequence and ‘-2’ as the penultimate index and the sequence
    carries forward like the positive number.

<p>
    The negative index is used to remove any new-line spaces from the string
    and allow the string to except the last character that is given as S[:-1].
    The negative index is also used to show the index to represent the string
    in correct order.
