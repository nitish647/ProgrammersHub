<p>C++ provides two pointer operators, which are (a) Address of Operator &amp; and (b) Indirection Operator *.</p>
<p>A pointer is a variable that contains the address of another variable or you can say that a variable that contains the address of another variable is said to "point to" the other variable. A variable can be any data type including an object, structure or again pointer itself.</p>
<p>The . (dot) operator and the -&gt; (arrow) operator are used to reference individual members of classes, structures, and unions.</p>
<h2>The Address of Operator &amp;</h2>
<p>The &amp; is a unary operator that returns the memory address of its operand. For example, if var is an integer variable, then &amp;var is its address. This operator has the same precedence and right-to-left associativity as the other unary operators.</p>
<p>You should read the &amp; operator as <strong>"the address of"</strong> which means <strong>&amp;var</strong> will be read as "the address of var".</p>
<h2>The Indirection Operator *</h2>
<p>The second operator is indirection Operator *, and it is the complement of &amp;. It is a unary operator that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand.</p>
<p>The following program executes the two operations</p>
