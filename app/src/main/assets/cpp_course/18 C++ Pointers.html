<p>C++ pointers are easy and fun to learn. Some C++ tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other C++ tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without them.</p>
<p>As you know every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using ampersand (&amp;) operator which denotes an address in memory. Consider the following which will print the address of the variables defined &minus;</p>

<span class="pun">}</span></pre>
<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">Address of var1 variable: 0xbfebd5c0
Address of var2 variable: 0xbfebd5b6
</pre>
<h2>What are Pointers?</h2>
<p>A <strong>pointer</strong> is a variable whose value is the address of another variable. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before you can work with it. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">type *var-name;
</pre>
<p>Here, <strong>type</strong> is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C++ type and <strong>var-name</strong> is the name of the pointer variable. The asterisk you used to declare a pointer is the same asterisk that you use for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being used to designate a variable as a pointer. Following are the valid pointer declaration &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">int    *ip;    // pointer to an integer
double *dp;    // pointer to a double
float  *fp;    // pointer to a float
char   *ch     // pointer to character
</pre>
<p>The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or constant that the pointer points to.</p>
<h2>Using Pointers in C++</h2>
<p>There are few important operations, which we will do with the pointers very frequently. <strong>(a)</strong> We define a pointer variable. <strong>(b)</strong> Assign the address of a variable to a pointer. <strong>(c)</strong> Finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand. Following example makes use of these operations &minus;</p>

<h2>Pointers in C++</h2>
<p>Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C++ programming. There are following few important pointer concepts which should be clear to a C++ programmer &minus;</p>
