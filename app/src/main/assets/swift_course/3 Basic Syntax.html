<p>We have already seen a piece of Swift program while setting up the environment. Let's start once again with the following <strong>Hello, World!</strong> program created for OS X playground, which includes <strong>import Cocoa</strong> as shown below &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit prettyprinted" style="cursor: default;"><span class="kwd">import</span> <span class="typ">Cocoa</span>

<span class="com">/* My first program in Swift */</span>
<span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> myString </span><span class="pun">=</span> <span class="str">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="pln">

println</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">myString</span><span class="pun">)</span></pre>
<p>If you create the same program for iOS playground, then it will include <strong>import UIKit</strong> and the program will look as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate prettyprinted"><span class="kwd">import</span> <span class="typ">UIKit</span>
<span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> myString </span><span class="pun">=</span> <span class="str">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="pln">
println</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">myString</span><span class="pun">)</span></pre>
<p>When we run the above program using an appropriate playground, we will get the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">Hello, World! 
</pre>
<p>Let us now see the basic structure of a Swift program, so that it will be easy for you to understand the basic building blocks of the Swift programming language.</p>
<h2>Import in Swift</h2>
<p>You can use the <strong>import</strong> statement to import any Objective-C framework (or C library) directly into your Swift program. For example, the above <strong>import cocoa</strong> statement makes all Cocoa libraries, APIs, and runtimes that form the development layer for all of OS X, available in Swift.</p>
<p>Cocoa is implemented in Objective-C, which is a superset of C, so it is easy to mix C and even C++ into your Swift applications.</p>
<h2>Tokens in Swift</h2>
<p>A Swift program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following Swift statement consists of three tokens &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">println("test!")
The individual tokens are:
println (
   "test!"
)
</pre>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Comments are like helping texts in your Swift program. They are ignored by the compiler. Multi-line comments start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">/* My first program in Swift */
</pre>
<p>Multi-line comments can be nested in Swift. Following is a valid comment in Swift &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">/* My first program in Swift is Hello, World!
/* Where as second program is Hello, Swift! */
</pre>
<p>Single-line comments are written using // at the beginning of the comment.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">// My first program in Swift
</pre>
<h2>Semicolons</h2>
<p>Swift does not require you to type a semicolon (;) after each statement in your code, though it&rsquo;s optional; and if you use a semicolon, then the compiler does not complain about it.</p>
<p>However, if you are using multiple statements in the same line, then it is required to use a semicolon as a delimiter, otherwise the compiler will raise a syntax error. You can write the above Hello, World! program as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit prettyprinted" style="cursor: default;"><span class="kwd">import</span> <span class="typ">Cocoa</span>
<span class="com">/* My first program in Swift */</span>
<span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> myString </span><span class="pun">=</span> <span class="str">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln"> println</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">myString</span><span class="pun">)</span></pre>
<h2>Identifiers</h2>
<p>A Swift identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with an alphabet A to Z or a to z or an underscore _ followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).</p>
<p>Swift does not allow special characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Swift is a <strong>case sensitive</strong> programming language. Thus, <em>Manpower</em> and <em>manpower</em> are two different identifiers in Swift. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">Azad       zara    abc   move_name  a_123
myname50   _temp   j     a23b9      retVal
</pre>
<p>To use a reserved word as an identifier, you will need to put a backtick (`) before and after it. For example, <strong>class</strong> is not a valid identifier, but <strong>`class`</strong> is valid.</p>
<h2>Keywords</h2>
<p>The following keywords are reserved in Swift. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names, unless they're escaped with backticks &minus;</p>

<h2>Whitespaces</h2>
<p>A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a Swift compiler totally ignores it.</p>
<p>Whitespace is the term used in Swift to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters, and comments. Whitespaces separate one part of a statement from another and enable the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">var age
</pre>
<p>there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between <strong>var</strong> and <strong>age</strong> for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">int fruit = apples + oranges   //get the total fruits
</pre>
<p>no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some for better readability.</p>
<h2>Literals</h2>
<p>A literal is the source code representation of a value of an integer, floating-point number, or string type. The following are examples of literals &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">92               // Integer literal
4.24159          // Floating-point literal
"Hello, World!"  // String literal
</pre>
