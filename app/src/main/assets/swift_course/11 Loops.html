<p>There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.</p>
<p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>
<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. Following is the general from of a loop statement in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>
<p><img src="images/loop_architecture.jpg" alt="Loop Architecture" /></p>
<p>Swift programming language provides the following kinds of loop to handle looping requirements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr><th>S.No</th><th style="text-align: center;">Loop Type &amp; Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>for-in
<p>This loop performs a set of statements for each item in a range, sequence, collection, or progression.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>for loop
<p>Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>while loop
<p>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>do...while loop
<p>Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>
<p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>
<p>Swift supports the following control statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr><th>S.No</th><th style="text-align: center;">Control Statement &amp; Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>continue statement
<p>This statement tells a loop to stop what it is doing and start again at the beginning of the next iteration through the loop.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>break statement
<p>Terminates the <strong>loop</strong> statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>fallthrough statement
<p>The fallthrough statement simulates the behavior of swift switch to C-style switch.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
