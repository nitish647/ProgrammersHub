<p>Decision making structures require that the programmer specifies one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be <strong>true</strong>, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be <strong>false</strong>.</p>
<p>Following is the general from of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>
<p><img src="images/decision_making.jpg" alt="Decision Making" /></p>
<p>Swift provides the following types of decision making statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr><th>S.No</th><th style="text-align: center;">Statement &amp; Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>if statement
<p>An <strong>if statement</strong> consists of a Boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>if...else statement
<p>An <strong>if statement</strong> can be followed by an optional <strong>else statement</strong>, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>if...else if...else Statement
<p>An <strong>if</strong> statement can be followed by an optional <strong>else if...else</strong> statement, which is very useful to test various conditions using single if...else if statement.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>nested if statements
<p>You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>switch statement
<p>A <strong>switch</strong> statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h2>The ? : Operator</h2>
<p>We have covered <strong>conditional operator ?</strong> : in the previous chapter which can be used to replace <strong>if...else</strong> statements. It has the following general form &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">Exp1 ? Exp2 : Exp3;
</pre>
<p>Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.</p>
<p>The value of a <strong>?</strong> expression is determined like this: Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire <strong>?</strong> expression. If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.</p>
