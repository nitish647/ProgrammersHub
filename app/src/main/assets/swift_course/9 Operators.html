<p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. Objective-C is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators &minus;</p>

<h2>Range Operators</h2>
<p>Swift includes two range operators, which are shortcuts for expressing a range of values. The following table explains these two operators.</p>
<p><a href="swift_range_operators.htm">Show Examples</a></p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr><th style="width: 24%;">Operator</th><th>Description</th><th style="width: 30%;">Example</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Closed Range</td>
<td>(a...b) defines a range that runs from a to b, and includes the values a and b.</td>
<td>1...5 gives 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Half-Open Range</td>
<td>(a..&lt; b) defines a range that runs from a to b, but does not include b.</td>
<td>1..&lt; 5 gives 1, 2, 3, and 4</td>
</tr>

<h2>Misc Operators</h2>
<p>Swift supports a few other important operators including <strong>range</strong> and <strong>?</strong> : which are explained in the following table.</p>
<p><a href="swift_misc_operators.htm">Show Examples</a></p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr><th style="width: 26%;">Operator</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Unary Minus</td>
<td>The sign of a numeric value can be toggled using a prefixed -</td>
<td>-3 or -4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unary Plus</td>
<td>Returns the value it operates on, without any change.</td>
<td>+6 gives 6</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ternary Conditional</td>
<td>Condition ? X : Y</td>
<td>If Condition is true ? Then value X : Otherwise value Y</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Operators Precedence</h2>
<p>Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression. This affects how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator.</p>
<p>For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.</p>
<p>Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.</p>
