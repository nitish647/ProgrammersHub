        <h1>Java - Collections Framework</h1>

        <div class="clearer"></div>
        <hr>
        <p>Prior to Java 2, Java provided ad hoc classes such as <b>Dictionary, Vector, Stack,</b> and <b>Properties</b> to store and manipulate groups of objects. Although these classes were quite useful, they lacked a central, unifying theme. Thus, the way that you used Vector was different from the way that you used Properties.</p>
        <p>The collections framework was designed to meet several goals, such as −</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><p>The framework had to be high-performance. The implementations for the fundamental collections (dynamic arrays, linked lists, trees, and hashtables) were to be highly efficient.</p></li>
            <li><p>The framework had to allow different types of collections to work in a similar manner and with a high degree of interoperability.</p></li>
            <li><p>The framework had to extend and/or adapt a collection easily.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Towards this end, the entire collections framework is designed around a set of standard interfaces. Several standard implementations such as <b>LinkedList, HashSet,</b> and <b>TreeSet</b>, of these interfaces are provided that you may use as-is and you may also implement your own collection, if you choose.</p>
        <p>A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. All collections frameworks contain the following −</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><p><b>Interfaces</b> − These are abstract data types that represent collections. Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. In object-oriented languages, interfaces generally form a hierarchy.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Implementations, i.e., Classes</b> − These are the concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are reusable data structures.</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Algorithms</b> − These are the methods that perform useful computations, such as searching and sorting, on objects that implement collection interfaces. The algorithms are said to be polymorphic: that is, the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to collections, the framework defines several map interfaces and classes. Maps store key/value pairs. Although maps are not <i>collections</i> in the proper use of the term, but they are fully integrated with collections.</p>
        <h2>The Collection Interfaces</h2>
        <p>The collections framework defines several interfaces. This section provides an overview of each interface −</p>

        <h2>The Collection Classes</h2>
        <p>Java provides a set of standard collection classes that implement Collection interfaces. Some of the classes provide full implementations that can be used as-is and others are abstract class, providing skeletal implementations that are used as starting points for creating concrete collections.</p>
        <p>The standard collection classes are summarized in the following table −</p>

        <h2>The Collection Algorithms</h2>
        <p>The collections framework defines several algorithms that can be applied to collections and maps. These algorithms are defined as static methods within the Collections class.</p>
        <p>Several of the methods can throw a <b>ClassCastException</b>, which occurs when an attempt is made to compare incompatible types, or an <b>UnsupportedOperationException</b>, which occurs when an attempt is made to modify an unmodifiable collection.</p>
        <p>Collections define three static variables: EMPTY_SET, EMPTY_LIST, and EMPTY_MAP. All are immutable.</p>
        <table class="table table-bordered">
            <tbody><tr>
                <th>Sr.No.</th>
                <th style="text-align:center;">Algorithm &amp; Description</th>

        <h2>How to Use an Iterator ?</h2>
        <p>Often, you will want to cycle through the elements in a collection. For example, you might want to display each element.</p>
        <p>The easiest way to do this is to employ an iterator, which is an object that implements either the Iterator or the ListIterator interface.</p>
        <p>Iterator enables you to cycle through a collection, obtaining or removing elements. ListIterator extends Iterator to allow bidirectional traversal of a list and the modification of elements.</p>
        <table class="table table-bordered">
            <tbody><tr>
                <th>Sr.No.</th>

            </tr>
            </tbody></table>
        <h2>How to Use a Comparator ?</h2>
        <p>Both TreeSet and TreeMap store elements in a sorted order. However, it is the comparator that defines precisely what <i>sorted order</i> means.</p>
        <p>This interface lets us sort a given collection any number of different ways. Also this interface can be used to sort any instances of any class (even classes we cannot modify).</p>

                <th>Sr.No.</th>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The Java collections framework gives the programmer access to prepackaged data structures as well as to algorithms for manipulating them.</p>
        <p>A collection is an object that can hold references to other objects. The collection interfaces declare the operations that can be performed on each type of collection.</p>
        <p>The classes and interfaces of the collections framework are in package java.util.</p>
